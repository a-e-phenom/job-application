- URLs are persistent and can be shared directly

### 2. **Direct Access to Flows**
- Users can access any flow directly by navigating to its URL
- No need to go through the homepage to find a specific flow
- Perfect for sharing flows with candidates or team members

### 3. **Copy URL Feature**

### 4. **URL Preview During Creation**

## How to Use

2. Replace `[flow-slug]` with the actual slug of the flow
3. The flow will load directly without going through the homepage

## Technical Details

```
